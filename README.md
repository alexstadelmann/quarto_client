# Game Client for Quarto

### Quarto is a board game for two players.

With this program, you can connect to a game server at LMU (Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich) and play Quarto against someone else or let the client AI play autonomously.

Note: The university's game server can be accessed only from within its private network.
